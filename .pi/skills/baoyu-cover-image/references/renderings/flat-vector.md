# flat-vector

Clean, modern, geometric illustration

## Core Characteristics

Flat design with clean outlines, uniform fills, and no texture or depth. Think modern app icons, infographic illustrations, and vector-based editorial art.

## Lines

- Clean outlines with uniform stroke weight
- Closed shapes (coloring-book style)
- Rounded line endings, avoid sharp corners
- Consistent stroke width throughout

## Texture

- None: smooth, flat color fills only
- No gradients, shadows, or noise
- Solid color blocks

## Depth

- Flat: no shadows, no perspective
- 2D layering with overlap for depth illusion
- Optional 2.5D isometric layering (front/back occlusion, no atmospheric perspective)
- No 3D effects or bevels

## Element Vocabulary

- Geometric icons and simple shapes
- Bold outlined objects with clean fills
- Geometric simplification: complex objects → basic shapes (trees → lollipop/triangle, buildings → rectangles)
- "Toy model" aesthetic: cute, rounded proportions
- Decorative: dots, lines, sunbursts, pill-shaped clouds, small stars
- Isolated elements on clean backgrounds

## Typography Approach

- Clean sans-serif or bold geometric lettering
- Strong readability, consistent weight
- Easily scalable at any size
