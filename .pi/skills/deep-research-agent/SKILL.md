# Deep Research Agent

Build intelligent autonomous research agents that systematically investigate topics, evaluate sources, synthesize findings, and produce comprehensive reports.

## Research Workflow

### Stage 1: Research Planning
See [examples/research_planner.py](examples/research_planner.py) for `ResearchPlanner`:
- Define research questions
- Identify key research areas
- Plan information sources and evaluation criteria
- Create research timeline

### Stage 2: Source Gathering
Gather sources from multiple channels:
- Academic databases (Google Scholar, PubMed, JSTOR)
- News sources and publications
- Industry reports and whitepapers
- Web and social media searches
- Expert interviews

### Stage 3: Source Evaluation
See [examples/source_evaluator.py](examples/source_evaluator.py) for `SourceEvaluator`:
- Evaluate author expertise
- Assess publisher credibility
- Check information recency
- Identify potential biases

### Stage 4: Information Extraction
Extract structured data from sources:
- Key findings and main points
- Statistics and quantitative data
- Expert opinions and perspectives
- Emerging trends
- Research gaps

### Stage 5: Synthesis & Analysis
See [examples/research_synthesizer.py](examples/research_synthesizer.py) for `ResearchSynthesizer`:
- Identify main conclusions
- Organize supporting evidence
- Identify conflicting viewpoints
- Detect research gaps
- Suggest future research directions

### Stage 6: Report Generation
See [examples/research_report_generator.py](examples/research_report_generator.py) for `ResearchReportGenerator`:
- Generate executive summaries
- Format findings with evidence
- Present conflicting views
- Identify gaps and opportunities
- Create comprehensive reports with citations

## Research Agent Implementation

Build a comprehensive research agent by:
1. Creating research plans with `ResearchPlanner`
2. Gathering sources from multiple channels
3. Evaluating sources with `SourceEvaluator`
4. Extracting structured information
5. Synthesizing findings with `ResearchSynthesizer`
6. Generating reports with `ResearchReportGenerator`

## Specialized Research Types

### Market Research
Build market research capabilities:
- Estimate market size and growth rates
- Identify key competitors and market players
- Analyze market segments and entry barriers
- Identify opportunities and threats
- Track industry trends

### Competitive Intelligence
Build competitive intelligence analysis:
- Identify direct and indirect competitors
- Analyze competitor products and pricing
- Estimate market share and positioning
- Assess strengths and weaknesses
- Track competitive strategies and moves

### Literature Review
Build literature review automation:
- Search academic databases systematically
- Extract paper metadata and abstracts
- Analyze contributions and methodologies
- Identify key themes and connections
- Generate literature review synthesis
